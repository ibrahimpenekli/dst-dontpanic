# Don't Panic

![Preview](readme_preview.jpg)

Alerts players by text against season boss and hound/worm attacks.

Only players near the target player will hear the warning sound from Deerclops and Bearger. So, this mod makes your life easier if you play with a friend next to you has speakers muted.

Supported monsters:
- Deerclops
- Bearger
- Hounds or worms

Options:
- Off: Disables announcement
- Default: Alerts only if monster is growling
- In a day: Alerts both before a day and when monster is growling
